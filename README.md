This program is more than just a simple Morse code translator. It was specifically designed as a training environment to learn CW (Continuous Wave) effectively and sustainably from the ground up.

Featuring an integrated "Karaoke Mode" for visual feedback and an intelligent random word generator, it provides everything needed for daily practice.

► New in v.A03: A dedicated Exam Mode (Blind Test) and precise control over word generation for targeted learning.

To decode Morse code fluently in your head, this program utilizes two world-renowned learning methods:

► 1. The Koch Method (Character Training)
Avoid the "visual bridge" trap (trying to memorize dots and dashes on paper). The Koch method starts with only a few characters (e.g., K and M) at their full target speed. As soon as you reach 90% accuracy, you add another character. Use the checkboxes in the Training Mode to select your current character set!

► 2. The Farnsworth Method (The Timing)
The individual characters are played at a high speed (e.g., 20 WPM) so you learn the "melody" of the letter. To give your brain time to process, the spaces between characters and words are artificially lengthened. As you improve, you reduce these spaces until you reach standard timing.

Interactive Karaoke Display:
The character currently being played is highlighted in green—perfect for verification.

Intelligent Test Generator:
Select your Koch characters. The program automatically finds real words (Amateur Radio abbreviations, Q-codes, numbers, or common German/English terms).

NEW: Customize the maximum word length (1–9 characters) and the number of words (1–20).

NEW: Exam Mode (Blind Test):
Train under real-world conditions! After a 7-second countdown, playback starts without showing the text. Enter your solution afterward and let the system check it.

Adjustable Timing & Frequency:
Full control over WPM (5–40), character/word spacing, and pitch (450Hz – 800Hz).

Extended Character Set:
Includes German Umlaute (Ä, Ö, Ü) and standard prosigns.

│  Recommended Settings (IMPORTANT!)                                      │
╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
The default values (20 WPM, 550 Hz) are ideal for beginners:

Do not reduce the speed (WPM)! If you lower the WPM too much, you will fall into the habit of "counting dots and dashes," which creates a massive hurdle later on (the "10-WPM wall").

If it feels too fast, do not lower the WPM. Instead, increase the spacing between characters (Farnsworth Principle).

600 Hz corresponds to the standard sidetone of many modern transceivers and is easy on the ears.

🛠 Installation & Usage
Since this is a portable web application:

Download the morse_vA03.html file.

Open it in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge).

No internet connection is required once the file is saved.
